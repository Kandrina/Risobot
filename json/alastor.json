        "May I speak now?",
        "Excuse my sudden visit, but I saw your fiasco on the picture show and I just couldn't resist. What a performance! Why, I haven't been that entertained since the stock market crash of 1929, hahaha... So many orphans.",
        "Dear, if I wanted to hurt anyone here, (voice becomes distorted) I would have done so already!",
        "Hahaha! Why does anyone do anything? Sheer, absolute boredom!",
        "Consider it an investment in ongoing entertainment for myself! I want to watch the scum of the world struggle to climb up the hill of betterment! Only to repeatedly trip, and tumble down to the fiery pit of failure.",
        "Hahaha! It's the purest kind, my dear. Reality! True passion! After all, the world is a stage. And a stage is a world of entertainment.",
        "Smile, my dear! You know, you're never fully dressed without one!",
        "Hah! No.",
        "Do I know you?",
        "Well, I'm starved! Who wants some Jambalaya?",
        "My mother once showed me a wonderful recipe for Jambalaya, in fact, it nearly killed her! Hahaha! You could say the kick was right out of hell! Oh ho ho, I'm on a roll! Yes sir, this is the start of some real changes down here! The game is set!",
        "Now... stay tuned."
