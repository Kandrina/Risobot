        "Intriguing. I'm curious to know who you are. But, I don't have time to waste. If you're a Stand User, I'll need you to die.",
        "A close-ranged, power type. That's the sort of ability you have... As long as I know your range is 2 to 3 meters, then this assassination... is complete.",
        "Am I even closer than I thought... to what I must seek? I wish to know what you are. I wish to see your true form... I must discover that as I take your life!",
        "Even if you know the truth behind my Stand, Metallica,... it is too late. Because at this point, I am already done with you!",
        "No matter how heavily someone breathes after massive amounts of iron have been stolen from their body... no oxygen will be absorbed into it! Your body becomes a corpse before you have even died."
