        "Secco, you've got all of that, right!? Those looks of desperation on their faces as they clung to life!... Ooooooooh!! Yosh yosh yosh yosh yosh yosh yosh yosh yosh yosh yosh yosh yosh yosh yosh!!! That's an excellent recording, Secco!",
        "Three!? You want three of these sweet things? Three... You greedy rascal!!",
        "The spiritual power of humans emerges when their curiosity is stimulated. It is not the will to live, but curiosity which drives humans to evolve! I can't wait to see! I can't wait to see how these people will die...",

        "You see, Giorno Giovanna, I believe there are two cases in which happiness exists. The first is when despair turns into hope, then you become happy. When you caught the heli in your plants, I was just so panicked, I truly felt despair. But, I survived. I used my experience and mental strength to make a comeback and right now I feel happiness because of it... I truly do. [...] And the second situation where you feel happiness is...! When you look down on someone as they fall into despair!",

        "Let me see the look on your face at the moment your hope burns out and your life reaches its end! Show me your despair as you fall! Uwahahhahahahahahaha!!!!",
        "The strong are qualified to rule over the weak... No, fate commands the strong to rule over everyone else.",
        "B-But you promised... that if I stayed still... you wouldn't harm me..."
